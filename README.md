# HandlePermission

HandlePermission is an Android library that makes requesting permissions at runtime much easier.

Android Marshmallow added a new functionality to let users grant permissions when running an app instead of granting them all when installing it. This approach gives the user more control but requires developers to add lots of boilerplate code to support it.

# Overview

* Consistent API across android versions
* API for activity and fragment

# Add it to your project
